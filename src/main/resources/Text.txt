I don't know if any of you have the slightest idea of Dartmoor.
The place I am talking about is just on the border with it. It was a charming place, and a splendid estate, though, when advertised for sale, it was for some years unsuccessful, perhaps because it was marked by a number of strange and original features. But it was bought by a man called Haydon - Sir Richard Haydon. I knew him from college, and though I had lost sight of him for some time, the old bonds of friendship were strong, and I gladly accepted his invitation to visit ‘Quiet Grove,’ as he called his acquisition.

The party was not a grand one: Richard Haydon himself, his cousin Elliot Haydon, Lady Mannering and her colourless daughter Violet, Captain Rogers and his wife, both tanned, weathered, and with the figures of good riders. Among the guests I met both young Dr Symonds and Miss Diana Ashley. Her name said something to me. Diana's pictures were often in the society section of the press, and she was one of the beauties of the season. Her looks were truly stunning. Tall, dark-haired, with gorgeous skin and always half-closed eyes, giving her a kind of oriental piquancy. She also had a beautiful voice, deep as a bell.
